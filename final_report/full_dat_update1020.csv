The Data Science Consultant (DSC) works directly with clients and project teams, providing essential insight and leverage on problems where data science expertise is essential.  S/he works to understand, describe and manage the lifecycle of analytics on a project from start to finish.  While deeply involved with the technical solution, a DSC works equally on the execution, communication and delivery of a client project, often acting as the team’s de facto tech lead.
As DSCs progress professionally, they tend towards greater depth in both data scientific principles and skills as well as domain-specific expertise, ‘majoring’ in a subset of industries and becoming increasingly recognized as pivotal individuals in pushing forward the frontier of our capabilities to crack increasingly broad problems – and, in doing so, to shape the evolution of the firm and the industries it serves.
DSCs thus develop the expertise to know which quantitative problems are the most valuable in a certain industry, to understand which features and model structures are best suited to solving them, and to know how to tune such solutions in light of industry specific requirements and ecosystems.  Ultimately, DSCs thus act as a crucial engine of progress, designing and maintaining assets and problem solving platforms.

An ‘engineering’ mindset, willing to make rapid, pragmatic decisions to improve performance, accelerate progress or magnify impact; recognizing that the ‘good’ is not the enemy of the ‘perfect’
Direct, hands-on experience managing the process of building a model, incorporating features, tuning performance, and deploying into production
Knowing how and when to make trade-offs between incremental accuracy and exception-free performance
An ability to communicate the solution, its parameters, its assumptions and its inner workings to heterogeneous audiences, who vary widely in their levels of technical fluency and seniority

We’ll get the very best equipment available so you can do your very best work. MacBook Pro Retina? Check. Two monitors? Check. Everyone gets noise-cancelling headphones to zone out when coding, and many people use standing desks.

Job Description:
Want to change how the world engages with news and data?
Selerity has dominated ultra-low-latency data science in finance for several years.  Now our real-time content analytics and contextual recommendation platform is gaining broader traction in enterprise and media applications.  We're tackling big challenges in predictive analytics, conversational interfaces, and workflow automation and need your help!
We’re looking for an experienced developer to join a major initiative at a critical point in our company’s growth.  The majority of the development will be in Java on Linux but knowledge of other languages, platforms and levels of the stack is very helpful.

Must-haves:
  * Possess a rock-solid background in Computer Science (minimum BS in Comp Sci or related field) + at least 5 years (ideally 10+) of challenging work experience.
  * Demonstrated expert-level proficiency building systems in Java in Linux environments.

  * Solid track record of making effective design decisions balancing near-term and long-term objectives.
  * Know when to use commercial or open-source solutions, when to delegate to a teammate, and when to roll up your sleeves and code it yourself.
  * Work effectively in agile teams with remote members; get stuff done with minimal guidance and zero BS, help others, and know when to ask for help.
  * Clearly communicate complex technical and product issues to non-technical team members, managers, clients, etc.  

Nice-to-haves:
  * Full-stack development and operations experience with web apps on Node.js.
  * Implementation of DevOps / SRE processes at scale including continuous integration, automated testing, and platform monitoring.
  * Experience with analytics visualization libraries.

  * Implementation of software defined networking or other non-traditional networking paradigms.
  * Deep understanding of how to build software agents and conversational workflows.
  * Experience with additional modern programming languages (Scala, Python, …)

Our stack combines leading commercial and open source technologies with  numerous home-grown innovations, including:
 * Java, C++, JavaScript/ECMAscript + Node, Angular, RequireJS, Electron, Scala, Python, etc.
 * A variety of open source and in-house frameworks for natural language processing and machine learning including artificial neural networks / deep learning.
 * Hybrid of AWS (EC2, S3, RDS, R53) + dedicated datacenter network, server and GPU/coprocessor infrastructure.
 * Cassandra, Aurora plus in-house streaming analytics pipeline (similar to Apache Flink) and indexing/query engine (similar to ElasticSearch).
 * In-house messaging frameworks for low-latency (sub-microsecond sensitivity) multicast and global-scale TCP (similarities to protobufs/FixFast/zeromq/itch).
 * Ansible, Git, Subversion, PagerDuty, Icinga, Grafana, Observium, LDAP, Jenkins, Maven, Purify, VisualVM, Wireshark, Eclipse, Intellij 
This position offers a great opportunity to work with advanced technologies, collaborate with a top-notch, global team and disrupt a highly visible, multi-billion-dollar market.  

Compensation:
We understand how to attract and retain the best talent and offer a competitive mix of salary, benefits and equity.  We also understand how important it is for you to feel challenged, to have opportunities to learn new things, to have the flexibility to balance your work and personal life and to know that your work has impact in the real world.  We have team members on four continents and we're adept at making remote workers feel like part of the team.  If you join our NYC main office be sure to bring your Nerf toys, your drones and your maker gear - we’re into that stuff, too.

Interview Process:
If you can see yourself at Selerity, send your resume and/or online profile (e.g. LinkedIn) to careers@selerityinc.com.  We’ll arrange a short introductory phone call and if it sounds like there’s a match we'll arrange for you to meet the team for a full interview.  
The interview process lasts several hours and is sometimes split across two days.  It is intended to be challenging - but the developers you meet and the topics you’ll be asked to explain (and code!) should give you a very clear sense of what it would be like to work at Selerity.  
We value different perspectives and have built a team that reflects that diversity while maintaining the highest standards of excellence.  You can rest assured that we welcome talented engineers regardless of their age, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity or national origin.
