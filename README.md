# Zillow Project

The goal of the Zillow Prize challenge is to build a model to improve the Zestimate residual error in order to ensure homeowners have a trusted way to monitor their assests at any given point in time. “Zestimates” are estimated home values based on 7.5 million statistical and machine learning models that analyze hundreds of data points on each property.

This data-driven exercise harnesses all made-available home features data, the transactional training and test data. Uncovering and acting on the opportunities the dataset presents is not possible without having a reliable ground source of truth. Hence it is compulsory to assure completeness, consistency, uniqueness, validity and accuracy of the data before starting any ML process. Data cleaning and preparation are hence the most important steps in building a good ML prediction model because the quality of the data is one of the most significant factors in the accuracy and usefulness of the results.
