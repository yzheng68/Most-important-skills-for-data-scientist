# Zillow Project

The goal of the Zillow Prize challenge is to build a model to improve the Zestimate residual error in order to ensure homeowners have a trusted way to monitor their assests at any given point in time. “Zestimates” are estimated home values based on 7.5 million statistical and machine learning models that analyze hundreds of data points on each property.
