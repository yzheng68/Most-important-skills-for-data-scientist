The Data Science Consultant (DSC) works directly with clients and project teams, providing essential insight and leverage on problems where data science expertise is essential.  S/he works to understand, describe and manage the lifecycle of analytics on a project from start to finish.  While deeply involved with the technical solution, a DSC works equally on the execution, communication and delivery of a client project, often acting as the team’s de facto tech lead.
As DSCs progress professionally, they tend towards greater depth in both data scientific principles and skills as well as domain-specific expertise, ‘majoring’ in a subset of industries and becoming increasingly recognized as pivotal individuals in pushing forward the frontier of our capabilities to crack increasingly broad problems – and, in doing so, to shape the evolution of the firm and the industries it serves.
DSCs thus develop the expertise to know which quantitative problems are the most valuable in a certain industry, to understand which features and model structures are best suited to solving them, and to know how to tune such solutions in light of industry specific requirements and ecosystems.  Ultimately, DSCs thus act as a crucial engine of progress, designing and maintaining assets and problem solving platforms.

Looking for an opportunity to actually use the knowledge and problem solving creativity you spent years acquiring? Take a look at Catalina. We are seeking candidates who want to join the Agency/Ad Platform team focused on building integrated, scalable systems that integrate across multiple sources.
We are seeking an experienced solutions architect to join our AdTech team. The ideal candidate will use their AdTech and Video expertise to design innovative solutions to create significant value while owning the architecture of the end to end platform. Working directly with Product solutions, the Solutions Architect is a role of critical importance and the candidate should thrive in a fast paced environment globally across multiple teams. Take a second look at Catalina. Self-managing teams, open workspaces, collaboration – you’ll get it all in this fast-paced environment where technology is not an afterthought, but has been a key part of our strategic direction for 30+ years… and we are just getting started. All that is missing is you!
What You’ll Do:
There are certainly some benefits to working on a system that has a handful of users in the same building as the engineering team. However, if you really want your skills as a software engineer to be challenged, consider working on products that are touching real consumers in the real world. You’ll get that on Catalina’s Platform engineering team, where you’ll be working on distributed, highly available cloud applications that interact with millions of consumers every day around the world to deliver personalized marketing content.
What you’ve done:
10+ years of experience working in a technical customer facing Solutions Architect role at an AdTech company designing high availability and scalability solutions
Deep technical understanding of the AdTech industry and technologies
3+ years working with a DSP or DSP adoptions
Comfort traversing the whole stack: client-side through the persistence layer
Experience designing, architecting, implementing and/or operating within a cloud platform (Amazon, Azure, etc..)
Experience with DoubleClick, AdWords, Google Analytics or similar platforms
Understanding of search marketing, ad serving platforms and API development/management
Experience in automation (Puppet, Chef, Vagrant)
Experience with In-Memory Caching, Queues, Protocols, SOLR, Avro, Protocol Buffers, Thrift
Experience with terabytes of information on big data (hadoop, hbase, hive) for aggregation and rollup
What You’ll Bring:
A passion for building software and delivering technology for business.  If you are looking for an average 9 to 5 job, this might not be the one for you.
Commitment to quality over quantity.  When consumers are your end-user, you can’t afford to launch with issues.
A desire to collaborate, more often than not.  You won’t spend much time in isolation here at Catalina.
An ability to create streamlined applications that perform under load.  Our systems have less than a second to respond or revenue is lost.
A good working knowledge of Agile software engineering processes.  Bonus points if you have helped another organization make the transition.
Clear communication skills.  We are looking for someone who is comfortable talking to peers about a design solution on the same day they are explaining a new technology to an executive.
A desire to focus on results, less on non-value activities.  As a lean IT professional on the team, you’ll have goals to meet, and the freedom to meet those goals in the most effective manner possible.
Nice to have in your bag of tricks (not required, but let us know):
Community developer presence (github, apache, open source projects, etc..)
Scalable Microservice design experience
TDD/BDD expert

You can help making the world a better place. One spark-submit at a time.
Summary
Institution: École Polytechnique
Location: Palaiseau, France
Required Skills: Apache Spark (Scala) | Big Data
Bonus Skills: Python | Machine Learning | TDD
Languages: English and/or French
Who are we?
Ecole polytechnique is intensively developing its research activity on big data technologies and data science through the Data Science Initiative program. Several research projects in this field are already involving different laboratories, including the CMAP (center for applied mathematics) and the LIX (laboratory for informatics).
The Data Science Initiative research team is seeking for a Software Engineer to work on one of our main projects. We are working on pattern detection using machine learning techniques on one of the world’s largest health database. This database records every health related transaction for more than 60 millions people, resulting in hundreds of Terabytes of data. The project outcome will have a broad societal impact, either from medical or economical viewpoints.
Our team is composed of several enthusiast mathematicians (international researchers and PhD students) and data-driven software engineers. It is a team with a big ambition, and a lot of room for creative solutions.
What we do
Right now, we are using a simple stack based on an HDFS - Spark cluster. We are also developing an open source C++/Python library called tick (you can check its Github page) that features several homemade machine learning algorithms for longitudinal data analysis.
The main workflow is quite standard:
Cleaning: from a production SQL database, we format the data in a (very) large denormalized table;
Featuring: we compute a lot (a lot) of features based on this table to create a large matrix;
Learning: we feed our homemade machine learning algorithm with this matrix and estimate a model.
Typical day
You develop a lot of stuff in Spark and try different design to improve our performances using any kind of kick-ass technology, all of that using a slick git workflow;
You walk across the campus and cross some students, teachers and horses;
You can play with a cluster to get better performance (or just to learn). You can also use large machines to run your code;
You can use the sport facilities on campus during if you want;
You are also part of every decision regarding the evolution of our architecture (such as numerous NoSQL debates for instance);
You are also looking for new libraries, releases, papers, conferences, literally anything that’s linked to your field of interest. The campus library is fully stocked, and you can order what’s missing.
Who are you?
Curious is your middle name.
GitHub and StackOverflow are your favorite social networks.
You know why you’re using Eclipse instead of IntelliJ or the other way around.
You spent several years studying computer science or mathematics and more time playing with algorithms. You acquired good programming skills and know about clean code, tests and versioning.
You’ve seen things. Weird implementations and hairy publications. Everywhere.
You dream in Scala or Python (and you don’t talk about nightmares).
You’ve heard of functional programming, but you’re not supposed to be killer at it.
Also, you know about the machine learning ecosystem and everything revolving around distributed computing.
You can survive at least a month without water or food on Unix and you’ve picked your stand between emacs and vi.
Bonus
You are either:
A killer in Scala;
A hardcore Spark developer;
Fluent in python;
An experienced sysadmin.
You will be able to:
Work in a highly challenging intellectual environment;
Wear sandals with socks (but why would you do that?);
Benefit from the campus infrastructure, which means that you could practice horse riding, golfing and water-polo, unfortunately not at the same time;
Use a lot of different technologies and try any that looks appealing to you;
Have access to adequate conferences, books and trainings if needed.

The Einstein AI Data Science team at Salesforce is looking for both Senior AND Lead Data Engineers with Scala and/or Spark experience, to help us take one of the world's most extensive data sets and transform it into amazing products that feel like magic.
A typical day for you might include the following:
Developing data infrastructure that is able to ingest and transform data at huge scale coming from many different sources, different customers, and in many different varieties.
Developing machine learning infrastructure that can generalize across hundreds of thousands of Salesforce customers, but is expressive enough to actually generate high lift.
Brainstorming data product ideas with the data scientists and engineers that built some of the most exciting data products that hundreds of millions people use every day.
Working with internal product teams to ingest their data and sprinkle machine learning fairy dust on their products.
Participating in meal conversations with your team members about really important topics, such as: Should the cuteness of panda bears be a factor in their survivability? Is love a decision tree or a regression model? How far ahead would society be today if we had 12 fingers instead of 10?
What we care about:
Please note that this is NOT an entry level, college graduate role; you MUST have industry experience, preferrably with Scala and/or Spark. Advanced degrees alone do not replace real world experience.
We're a growing, diverse team and we work together on projects. We love to collaborate and help each other, and we want someone to share that ideology.
You have to be a very quick learner - we face new challenges every day, anything that ranges between the operating model of a financial services companies to how to make Spark work with the S3 file system. No school could prepare you for all of these, so you need to be very quick on your feet.
We develop real products. You need to be an expert in coding. We use Scala and functional programming principles, great if you do too or are willing to learn.
We have massive scale. You need to have experience in distributed, scalable systems. Consistency / availability tradeoffs are made here. You've tinkered with modern data storage, messaging, and processing tools (Kafka, Spark, Hadoop, Cassandra, etc.)
We run on AWS. We dockerize applications. You should have some notion of how to build, test, and deploy code to run on cloud infrastructure.
You have to be self sufficient - we operate like a startup, so everyone might do a bit of everything to get things done. You have to want to make a difference - we don't like status quo. We are looking for people who want to excel at everything they do, while still being able to prioritize between the must-haves and nice-to-haves.

Use your technology expertise in a career like no other! As an FBI Special Agent, you will bring your skills, talents and integrity to a dedicated team working at the highest level to get ahead of threats, protect the American people and uphold the Constitution of the United States.
A “routine” day may include interviewing a subject for an ongoing investigation in the morning, testifying in court about a computer breach before lunch, planning an operation in the afternoon and speaking about cyber threats at a community event in the evening. You may participate in arrests or raids, and execute search warrants and other dangerous assignments. You must maintain a high level of physical fitness, think on your feet, and be able to effectively respond to life-threatening situations. In an organization made up of careers like no other, being a Special Agent can be a lifelong career of uncommon days and amazing experiences — as part of a mission-focused family that is One FBI.
Special Agents are responsible for enforcing more than 300 federal statutes, as well as conducting sensitive national security investigations.

You are a problem solver with great analytical skills and leadership experience; you know how to get things done both in a demanding team environment and independently. Your ability to adapt to changing situations and clearly communicate across management, peer groups, external communities and stakeholders contributes to your ability to keep our nation safe. You’re naturally curious and always driven to find a solution. You notice minute details, yet remain strategic. You objectively evaluate information and make sound judgments. Honesty and integrity are more than just words to you — they are the foundation of who you are. You take pride in making a difference in the communities you serve, and bringing your background and unique skills to initiatives that impact our most important stakeholders: the American people.
In this role, you’ll be expected to use both established and innovative approaches to tackle some of the toughest challenges of our age. This opportunity should not be taken lightly.

What We Do
The team at MapLarge builds cutting edge products for data analytics and visualization to make the world safer, more productive, and more efficient.  The Maplarge API provides real time geospatial analytics for over 15 billion location events per day and trillions of historical events. Analysts using our geospatial visualization capability can instantly visualize and publish for data discovery and model testing on any desktop, mobile or tablet device.
Who We Need
Cultural Fit - While we hire all kinds of people and invent roles to fit them, there are three key traits we require of every team member that really define our team.
Extremely Smart - We work on cutting edge hard problems and we need people who can both architect and code these systems at the same time while working with a highly intelligent peer group.  
Passionate Engineers - We need people who really love programming and exhibit the energy and creativity that comes from being fully engaged in what you do.
Fun to Work With - Life is short and work should be fun.  
Types of Roles
We need talented people to help add cool new features to our platform.  This role in particular is for a Senior Engineer who is comfortable with Full Stack Web Development and has active TS/SCI clearances.  Below are the general categories of tasks we are working on, but often people straddle multiple areas so take them more as the general ""gist"" of what you might do with us. We are looking for smart, hard working, fun people and we will invent the right role to fit them.  The key trait we are looking for is self starting people who like to both architect/design and write the code for complex systems.  
(1) Client Side - Interactive Visuals: We maintain a JavaScript API for for interactive Data Visualization using our high performance web services. We need people both to help add new dynamic animated UI components and other features to the JS API. We also need people to build data driven visuals for our demo gallery if you are artistically or data analysis inclined. Enjoy working with Knockout, Angular, D3.js, HTML5? Check our our galleries to see the kind of stuff you will be working on http://maplarge.com/demos
(2) Full Stack Web Services - Full stack developers who are comfortable working on both client and server side to produce high performance applications powered by scalable web services are the backbone of our team.  We run C# in both .net and mono server side and also maintain a flexible client side API with a large library of reusable components. We host and run large deployments that sometimes scale to thousands of computers for scientific/industrial/gov users and in a typical day process data over 15 billion records from 110 million streaming data sources.  
(3) Algorithm / Core Database Development -  We built our own in-memory database and distributed data analytics pipeline from the ground up with funding from DARPA, and we have a team of talented researchers working on Pattern analysis, Streaming analytics, Spatial queries and Network graph functions that power our visual engines. We are always looking for practical people who love writing highly optimized code that straddles the line between research and software development. We don't usually publish scientific papers, but we are right out on the edge pulling algorithms out of the latest research papers finding really fast ""good enough"" approaches that let us tease interesting patterns out of data without getting lost in ""science experiment land.""

Our developers build applications that fuel the markets by providing intelligent analytics and transparency to level the playing field.
We share a passion for solving today’s problems by innovating for tomorrow. Our engineers write high performance, low latency and scalable code using proprietary and open source technologies to develop large-scale systems.

We build applications to analyze market trends, compare and contrast companies, evaluate analyst predictions and refine investment ideas.

Our platform gives them real-time currency data and allows them to perform analysis. You will help develop high visibility applications for valuation, trade idea generation and discovery of various FX instruments and their best prices; you will also help us build high-volume, real-time pricing engines to provide Bloomberg's version of FX market prices.

Purpose of the position
To design and implement a data management infrastructure (databases & tools) that serves the MOH’s requirements for interoperability and analytics, and to teach others how to sustain the infrastructure using industry-standard techniques and  open source data integration tools
The March 2017 HIS interoperability strategy and roadmap update recommends progressively implementing a data hub concept followed by data marts and an enterprise data warehouse. A data warehouse architect is required to assess the interoperability and analytic requirements of specific HIS applications.  For example, the architect needs to determine if data should be transformed to adhere to a dimensional prior to the start of analysis.  In addition, a data warehouse architect is required to provide mentoring and technical support to the systems analyst who will be accessing different data sources in order to create entries for the data catalog and system context diagram.
 What you’ll do
To perform this job successfully, an individual must be able to perform each essential duty satisfactorily. Other duties may be assigned.
 i.  Activities:
Develop strategies for data acquisition, data warehouse implementation and backup and recovery.
Consult with the Systems Architect and Technical Working Group (TWG) to determine if integration use cases are best approached through direct use of APIs (application programming interfaces) or through an intermediate data hub and ETL.
Act as a focal point for data-related inquiries.
Design and implement relational database schemas for storage and processing.
Perform day-to-day administration of the databases that contain the data hub and data marts, including backup and recovery.
Use ETL (extract, transform and load) techniques and an open source data integration tool to access, cleanse, conform and transfer data between HIS systems
Ensure that ETL jobs and transformations leverage the Data Catalogue to improve service levels and reduce maintenance costs.
Monitor and troubleshoot ETL jobs and transformations.
Document, then train and progressively transfer operational responsibility to individuals at the MoH.
 ii. Expected Outputs/Outcomes:
A data hub and data marts will be designed, implemented, deployed and maintained in production.  Pending review of requirements, an enterprise data warehouse will also be deployed.
Individual departments within the MoH will be able to access the data hub and data marts, reducing dependency on department-specific databases.
Application interoperability decisions will be made in consultation with the Data Warehouse Architect, leading to the consistent selection of appropriate integration techniques.
Procedural documentation and informal training materials will be created and communicated to the MoH for use in mentoring staff who will take over operational responsibility for the data hub and data marts.
Related work products (e.g. ETL jobs and transformations, shell scripts, SQL queries) will be maintained under version control in a GitHub repository.

                ""Skills & requirements
                        
Who you are
The requirements listed below are representative of the knowledge, skill and/or ability required to successfully perform this job:
Five or more years of experience performing data warehouse architecture development and management.
Proficiency with dimensional modeling techniques such as star schema design.
Experience with interoperability concepts and techniques such as scheduled and event-driven data transfer.
Ability to determine if available data can meet business analytical requirements and to remediate where possible.
